Bored of writing boilerplate code in every new Android project to handle states, events, effects, etc?

Just use Composer!

You're probably familiar with declaring Ui states for every screen in your app. Most of the time it was just a sealed class, for example:
```kotlin
sealed class HomeState {
    object Initial : HomeState()
    object Loading : HomeState()
    data class Success(...) : HomeState()
    data class Error(val throwable: Throwable) : HomeState()
    ...
}
```

Most of the screens you create will look like this. Initial, Loading, Success, Error like states. So is it worth writing it every time? Nope.

Using composer's SimpleUiState and/or ComplexUiState gives you access to these predefined states for every screen:

- Loading
- Retrying
- SwipeRefreshing
- Success
- Failure
- SwipeRefreshingFailure

This should cover most of the cases for you. If not, you can create custom states for a specific screen/case/etc.

## Quickstart

Imagine you want to create a new feature (let's say it's one screen for now).

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel : ViewModel {
    // ViewModel logic
}
```

### State handling

You've created a new ViewModel and you want to hold the screen's state inside. With composer it is really easy.

#### SimpleUiState

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel : ViewModel(),
    SimpleUiStateManager by SimpleUiStateManagerImpl(
        initialState = SimpleUiState.Loading
    ) {
    // ViewModel logic
}
```

Next, create a composable function that will present the state, based on the ComposerViewModel:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun HomeScreen(
    homeViewModel: HomeViewModel = viewModel() // use your DI to get the ViewModel
) {
    SimpleUiStateView(homeViewModel) {
        HomeScreenSuccessStateView()
    }
}
```

Installation
=======
Composer framework is still in progress, but you can still use it if you want. Just add this to your build.gradle dependencies section:

```kotlin
implementation 'com.github.k0siara:composer:0.0.1'
```
